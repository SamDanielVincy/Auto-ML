# Machine Learning Hub

Welcome to the Machine Learning Hub! This project is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline machine learning workflows, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. It provides an intuitive interface to perform various machine learning tasks without the need for extensive coding.

## Project Overview

The Machine Learning Hub offers the following features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Upload datasets, handle missing values, and select preprocessing techniques.
- **Model Training**: Train and evaluate various machine learning models, including classification and regression algorithms.
- **Model Comparison**: Compare the performance of different models using metrics like accuracy, MSE, and R².
- **Visualization**: Visualize model performance and feature importance using interactive charts.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Make predictions on new data using trained models.
- **Model Download**: Save and download trained models for future use.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for ease of use.
- **Multiple Model Support**: Includes algorithms for both classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and regression (e.g., Linear Regression).
- **Performance Metrics**: Provides accuracy, MSE, and R² scores for model evaluation.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Visualize model performance with interactive charts.
- **File Handling**: Upload datasets, preprocess data, and download trained models.
